1.25 MW Wind Power Project at Dhule

The proposed project titled under UCR is “1.25 MW Wind Power Project at Dhule”, which is wind
power project located in Dhule district in the state of Maharashtra (India). The generated electricity is
sold to M/s Thermax Limited through Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). PP has the full ownership of
the project activity. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently
being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

A.1.1 Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 1.25 MW manufactured and
supplied by Seimens Ltd. respectively in district Dhule of the state of Maharashtra in India. This
project has been promoted by M/s Rindiam Export

The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 01/09/2005 by Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL).

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 2,190 MWh of electricity per
annum. Power Purchase Agreement is signed between M/s Rindiam Exports and M/s Thermax
Limited. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity resulting in
emission reduction of 1,971 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been helping in greenhouse
gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for generating power
which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by
fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 1,971 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.

Since the project activity generates electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts
